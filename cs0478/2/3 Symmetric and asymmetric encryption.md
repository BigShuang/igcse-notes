## 3 Symmetric and asymmetric encryption
对称和非对称加密

### 1 The purpose of encryption
minimise this risk of it being intercepted by, for example, a hacker.

Encryption cannot prevent the data being intercepted, but it stops it from making any sense to the eavesdropper. 

### 2 Symmetric and asymmetric encryption

#### Symmetric encryption
对称加密
Symmetric encryption uses an encryption key; the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the encoded message. 

The real difficulty is keeping the encryption key a secret (for example, it needs to be sent in an email or a text message which can be intercepted). Therefore, the issue of security is always the main drawback of symmetrical encryption, since a single encryption key is required for both sender and recipient.

#### Asymmetric encryption

Asymmetric encryption was developed to overcome the security problems associated with symmetric encryption. 
It makes use of two keys called the **public key** and the **private key**

uses an algorithm to generate a matching pair of keys (private and public) that they must keep stored on their computers

public key used to encrypt the document
the private key used to decrypt it.
