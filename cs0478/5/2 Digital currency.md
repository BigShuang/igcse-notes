## 2 Digital currency
数字货币

### 1 What is digital currency?
Digital currency exists purely in a digital format. It has no physical form unlike conventional fiat currency (for example, $, £, €, and ¥).
数字货币纯粹以数字形式存在。 与传统法定货币（例如美元、英镑、欧元和日元）不同，它没有物理形式。

Digital currency relies on a central banking system.

The problem with centralisation is maintaining confidentiality and security; these have always been issues with digital currency systems. 
中心化的问题是维护机密性和安全性； 这些一直是数字货币系统的问题。 

However, one example of digital currency, known as cryptocurrency, has essentially overcome these issues by introducing decentralisation.
然而，数字货币的一个例子，即加密货币，通过引入去中心化从本质上克服了这些问题。

#### cryptocurrency
加密货币
- Cryptocurrency uses cryptography to track transactions; it was created to address the problems associated with the centralisation of digital currency.
加密货币使用密码学来跟踪交易； 它的创建是为了解决与数字货币中心化相关的问题。
- Traditional digital currencies are regulated by central banks and governments (in much the same way as fiat currencies). This means all transactions and exchange rates are determined by these two bodies. Cryptocurrency has no state control and all the rules are set by the cryptocurrency community itself.
传统数字货币受到中央银行和政府的监管（与法定货币的监管方式大致相同）。 这意味着所有交易和汇率均由这两个机构决定。 加密货币没有国家控制，所有规则均由加密货币社区本身制定。
- Unlike existing digital currencies, cryptocurrency transactions are publicly available and therefore all transactions can be tracked and the amount of money in the system is monitored.
与现有的数字货币不同，加密货币交易是公开的，因此所有交易都可以被追踪，系统中的金额也可以被监控。
- The cryptocurrency system works by being within a blockchain network which means it is much more secure.
加密货币系统通过区块链网络运行，这意味着它更加安全。

### 2 Blockchaining
区块链


Blockchain is a decentralised database. All the transactions of networked members are stored on this database. 
区块链是一个去中心化的数据库。 网络成员的所有交易都存储在该数据库中。


Essentially, the blockchain consists of a number of interconnected computers but they are not connected to a central server. 
本质上，区块链由许多互连的计算机组成，但它们不连接到中央服务器。
All transaction data is stored on all computers in the blockchain network.
所有交易数据都存储在区块链网络中的所有计算机上。
Whenever a new transaction takes place, all the networked computers get a copy of the transaction; 
每当发生新交易时，所有联网的计算机都会获得该交易的副本；
therefore it cannot be changed without the consent of all the network members. This effectively removes the risk of security issues such as hacking. 
因此，未经所有网络成员同意，不得更改。 这有效地消除了黑客攻击等安全问题的风险。

Blockchain is used in many areas, such as:
- cryptocurrency (digital currency) exchanges
加密货币（数字货币）交易所
- smart contracts
智能合约
- research (particularly within pharmaceutical companies)
研究（特别是在制药公司内）
- politics
政治
- education.
教育

#### How blockchain works
Whenever a new transaction takes place, a new block is created
- Data
- Hash value
- Previous hash value

genesis block: it doesn’t point to any previous block

This is prevented by **proof-of-work**, which makes sure it takes ten minutes to determine the necessary proof-of-work for each block before it can be added to the chain. 
这是通过工作量证明来防止的，它确保在将每个块添加到链之前需要十分钟的时间来确定每个块所需的工作量证明。

This is ‘policed’ by miners, which are special network users that get a commission for each new block created. 
这是由矿工“监管”的，他们是特殊的网络用户，为每个创建的新区块获得佣金。
