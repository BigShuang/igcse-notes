## 3.1 Computer architecture
### 1 The central processing unit (CPU)

The central processing unit (CPU) (also known as a microprocessor or processor) is central to all modern computer systems (including tablets and smartphones). 
中央处理器 (CPU)（也称为微处理器或处理器）是所有现代计算机系统（包括平板电脑和智能手机）的核心。

The CPU is very often installed as an integrated circuit on a single microchip. 
CPU 通常作为集成电路安装在单个微芯片上。
The CPU has the responsibility for the execution or processing of all the instructions and data in a computer application. 
CPU 负责执行或处理计算机应用程序中的所有指令和数据。

the CPU consists of:
- control unit (CU)
控制单元（CU）
- arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
算术逻辑单元 (ALU)
- registers and buses
寄存器和总线

### 2 Von Neumann architecture
冯·诺依曼架构

The von Neumann architecture had the following main novel features 
冯·诺依曼架构具有以下主要新颖特征

- the concept of a central processing unit (CPU or processor)
中央处理单元（CPU 或处理器）的概念
- the CPU was able to access the memory directly
CPU能够直接访问内存
- computer memories could store programs as well as data
计算机存储器可以存储程序和数据
- stored programs were made up of instructions which could be executed in sequential order
存储的程序由可以按顺序执行的指令组成

#### Components of the central processing unit (CPU)
The main components of the CPU are the Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU) and system clock.

#### System buses and memory

#### Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle
获取-解码-执行周期

### 3 Cores, cache and internal clock
核、高速缓存和内部时钟


### 4 Instruction set

Each operation will instruct the ALU and CU (which are part of the CPU). 

An operation is made up of an opcode and an operand.
