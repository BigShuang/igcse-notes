> 2 Data transmission
#### 1 Types and methods of data transmission
##### data packet
A data packet is when message/data is split up into smaller groups of bytes:
- for transmission over a network
- containing a header, payload and a trailer

##### Packet structure

A typical packet is split up into:
- a packet header:
IP address of the sender
IP address of the recipient
the sequence number of the data packet(allowing correctreassembly)
the size of the packet (in bytes)
- the payload:
  the actual data being sent in the packet.
- a trailer:
  a way of identifying the end of a packet
  contains an error checking method, such as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)

##### Packet switching
- The data is split up into a number of packets.
- Each packet will follow its own path from 'A' to 'B'.
- Routers (R1 to R10) will determine the path of each data packet.
- The routing selection depends on the number of packets (at each router).
- The shortest path available is always selected

##### Reassemble reasons
Data packets frequently reach the destination in a different order to the one in which they are sent …
which means the data packets need to be re-assembled into the correct order.

##### Packet switching benefits
- There is no need to tie up a single communications line.
- It is possible to overcome failed, busy or faulty lines by re-routing packets.
- It is relatively easy to expand package usage.
- A high data transmission rate is possible.

##### Packet switching disadvantages
-  Packets can be lost and need to be re-sent.
-  The method doesn’t work well with real-time streaming.
-  There is a delay at the destination while waiting for all of the packets to arrive and then  to reassemble them in the correct order

##### bouncing
the problems caused by data packets 'bouncing':
The network would grind to a halt as the number of lost packets mount up, ‘clogging up’ the system.
随着丢失数据包数量的增加，网络将逐渐停止，从而“堵塞”系统。

A **hop number** is added to the header of each packet to overcome this, and this number is reduced  by 1 every time it leaves a router

##### Data transmission
- **Simplex**: ONE DIRECTION ONLY
- **Half-duplex**: BOTH DIRECTIONS but NOT AT THE SAME TIME
- **Full-duplex**: BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME

simultaneously
同时地

- **Serial data transmission**: ONE BIT AT A TIME over a SINGLE WIRE/CHANNEL.

- **Parallel data transmission**: SEVERAL BITS OF DATA (usually one byte) are sent down SEVERAL CHANNELS/WIRES 

**Comparison of serial and parallel data transmission methods**
**Serial**
- less risk of externalinterference than with parallel (due tofewer wires)
- more reliable transmission over longer distances
- transmitted bits won't have the risk of being skewed (that isout of synchronisation)
- used if the amount of data being sent is relatively small since transmission rate is slower than parallel(for example, USB uses this method of data transmission)
- used to send data over long distances (for example, telephone lines)
- less expensive than parallel due to fewer hardware requirements

**Parallel**
- faster rate of data transmission than serial
- works well over shorter distances (for example, used in internal pathways on computer circuit boards)- since several channels/wires used to transmit data, the bits can arrive out of synchronisation (skewed)
- preferred method when speed is important
- if data is time-sensitive, parallelis the most appropriate transmission method
- parallel ports require more hardware, making them more expensive to implement than serial ports
- easier to program input/output operations when parallel used

##### universal serial bus (USB)
When a device is plugged into a computer using one of the USB ports:

- The computer automatically detects a device being connected.
- The device is automatically recognised and appropriate device driver software is loaded up.
- If a new device is connected for the first time, the computer will look for a device driver that matches the device;
if this is not available, the user is prompted to download the appropriate driver software 

**Benefits**
- devices plugged into the computer are automatically detected and deviced rivers are automatically loaded up
- connections can only fit one way preventing incorrect connections being made
- it has become an industry standard, which means considerable support isavailable
- can support different data transmission rates (from 1.5 Mbps to 5 Gbps)
- no need for external power source since cable supplies +5V power
- USB protocol notifies the transmitter to re-transmit data if any errors are detected; this leads to error-free data transmission
- it is relatively easy to add more USB ports if necessary, by using USB hubs
- USB is backward compatible (that is, older versions are still supported)

**Drawbacks**
- standard USB only supports a maximum cable length of 5m; beyond that, USB hubs are needed to extend the cable length
- even though USB is backward compatible,very early USB standards (V1) may not always be supported by the latest computers
- even the latest version 3 (V3) and version 4(V4)USB-C systems have a data transfer rate which is slow compared to, for example, Ethernet connections (Note:USBV2 has a maximum data transfer rate of480 Mbps.)
