## 1 Types of software and interrupts
### 1 System software and application software
APPLICATION SOFTWARE - SYSTEM SOFTWARE - HARDWARE

two types of software: 
- system software: Operating system, Utility programs, Device drivers
- application software: Spread sheet, Word processor, Data base, Internet browser, Games/ware

#### General features of system software
- set of programs to control and manage the operation of computer hardware
- provides a platform on which other software can run 
- required to allow hardware and software to run without problems
- provides a human computer interface (HCI)
- controls the allocation and usage of hardware resources.

these are programs that allow the hardware to run properly and allow the user to communicate with the computer

#### General features of application software
- used to perform various applications (apps) on a computer
- allows a user to perform specific tasks using the computer’s resources
- may be a single program (for example, NotePad) or a suite of programs (for 
example, Microsoft Office)
- user can execute the software as and when they require.


these are programs that allow the user to do specific tasks.

#### Utility software (utilities)
实用软件（实用程序）
Utility programs offered by most computer system software include

- virus checkers
- defragmentation software
- disk contents analysis and repair
- file compression and file management
- back-up software
- security
- screensavers.

### 2 Operating systems
functions in a typical operating system.

#### Human computer interface (HCI)
The human computer interface (HCI) is in the form of a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A CLI requires a user to type in instructions

A GUI allows the user to interact with a computer using pictures or symbols (icons) 

#### Memory management

#### Security management

#### Hardware peripheral management
硬件外设管理

#### File management

#### Interrupts

#### Platform for running of application software

#### Multitasking

#### Management of user accounts

### 3 Running of applications

Hardware <-> Firmware Firmware <-> interface between OS and h/ware <-> Operating system
