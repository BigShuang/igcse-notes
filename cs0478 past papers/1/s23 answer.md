#### e
two from:
- The result of the calculation is greater than 255.
  The value generated is larger than can be stored in the register

- The result of the calculation would require more than 8 bits to be represented.
A register has a predetermined number of bits and there are toomanw bits tor it

- 93
- 0D
#### b
1. 00001111
2. Any one from:
- The value becomes incorrect/inaccurate as the right most bits are lost
- It is divided by 8 
#### c
Any two from:
- Easier/quicker to understand/read/write
- Easier/quicker to debug
- Less likely to make a mistake
- Shorter representation // Takes up less screen space 

#### d
12D

### 12-3
#### a
A character set is used, such as Unicode/ASCII.
Each character has a unique binary value.

#### b
1. It reduces the file size 
2. Any four from:
- A compression algorithm is used
- … such as RLE/run length encoding
- Repeating words/characters/phrases are identified // Patterns are identified
- … and indexed
- … with number of occurrences
- … with their position 
3. Any two from:
e.g.
- To save storage space
- To make it quicker to transmit
- To make it small enough to attach to an email
- To reduce the bandwidth needed to transmit
