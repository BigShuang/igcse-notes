- … and an alert can be sent to warn Adele
- … this can help prevent hackers/malicious software (gaining access to the data)

**(d)** - It makes the data meaningless


#### 22 w11 Q4
**(a)**
One mark for identification of the method (max 2), two marks for describing how the method could be used
- Phishing
- A legitimate looking email is sent to her, asking her to click a link
- … this takes her to a fake website where she enters her bank details
- Pharming
- She accidentally downloads malicious software onto her computer
- … this redirects her legitimate website requests to a fake website where she enters her bank details
- Hacking
- A person gains unauthorised access to her computer
- .. they steal/view a data file that contains her bank details
- Spyware
- Records the key presses on her computer
- … this data is analysed for patterns and her bank details are identified

**(b)** 
**i**
- The data will be meaningless if it is stolen
**ii**
One from:
- Data is encrypted and decrypted using the same key/algorithm
Any three from:
- Data before encryption is known as plain text
- Data after encryption is known as cypher text
- Key is sent to receiver (to allow data to be decrypted) // Values are sent to receiver that are used to generate key

**iii**
Any three from:
- Firewall // proxy server
- Password
- Biometric device
- Virtual measure e.g. onscreen keyboard
- Two-step verification // two factor authentication
- Physical methods
- Antimalware // Antispyware // Antivirus

#### 21 w12 Q5
**(a)** Any three from:
− Password
− Add a biometric device to the laptop // set biometric password
− Use two-step verification // Use two factor authentication
− Physically lock the laptop away in a secure cupboard // Taking laptop with him at all times

**(b)**

**(i)** Any three from:
− A compression algorithm is used
− The resolution could be reduced
− Colour depth could be reduced // bits per pixel reduced
− Sounds not heard by human ear could be removed // Perceptual music shaping can be used
− Repeating frames could be removed

**(ii)** Any one from:
− Quality may be reduced
− Data is lost // original file cannot be reconstructed

**(c)**
**(i)** Any one from:
− Maintains quality // quality better than lossy
− Original file is retained // Data is not permanently lost
− A significant reduction in file size is not required

**(ii)** Any two from:
− Takes more time to transmit file // Takes more time to upload to web server // Takes more time to download to customer // Web page will load slower
− Takes up more storage space
− Data usage would be increased
− Uses more bandwidth

#### 20 s12 Q3
**(a)** Any four from:
− Encryption key is used
− Encryption algorithm is used
− Encryption key / algorithm is applied to plain text
− … to convert it into cypher text
− Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the text

**(b)** Any three from:
− Firewall
− Password
− Proxy server
− Physical methods (by example e.g. CCTV, Locks)
− Access rights
− Asymmetric encryption
− Disconnect from network

#### 20 w13 Q6
− Key // Algorithm
− Algorithm // Key (must be opposite of first one)
− Plain
− Cypher
− Key // Algorithm 

#### 20 m12 Q2
**(a)**
Data is sent down a single wire in a single direction only. 
- Serial
- Simplex
Data is sent down multiple wires in both directions, at the same time.
- Parallel
- Duplex
Data is sent down a single wire in both
directions, but never at the same time.
- Serial Halfduplex
