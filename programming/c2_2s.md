#### m23_qp_22 6
a)
One mark for each error identified and correction
- Line 05 OUTPUT UsefulEnergyOut should be INPUT UsefulEnergyOut
- Line 06 IF TotalEnergyIn <> -1 AND UsefulEnergy <> -1 should be:
IF TotalEnergyIn <> -1 AND UsefulEnergyOut <> -1
- Line 11 UNTIL TotalEnergyIn <> -1 OR UsefulEnergyOut <> -1 should be:
UNTIL TotalEnergyIn = -1 OR UsefulEnergyOut = -1

b)
One mark for checking for >= 92
One mark for outputting "A-rated" only if the condition is met
For example
```
IF Efficiency >= 92
  THEN
    OUTPUT "A-rated"
ENDIF
```

#### s23_qp_21 5
a)
One mark per mark point, max four
- Line 04 / IF Number < 0
should be IF Number > 0
- Line 10 / Exit ← 1 // Line 01/ Exit ← 1 and Line 02 / WHILE Exit <> 0
should be Exit ← 0 // should be Exit ← 0 and WHILE Exit = 0
- Line 13 / ENDIF
should be ENDWHILE
- Line 14 / OUTPUT "The total value of your numbers is ", Number
should be OUTPUT "The total value of your numbers is ", Total 

b)
One mark per mark point, max four
- Initialise a new (counting) variable
- … Count ← 0 // to count the acceptable numbers
- Insert a counting statement between lines 05 and 07
- … Count ← Count + 1
- Add a new output after the loop/after line 13 / at the end (of the program)
- … OUTPUT Count

#### m23_qp_22 2
One mark for each point:
• Initialisation of total to zero before loop
• appropriate loop controls
• totalling statement inside the loop, must use array Number[] with an index
• calculation of average outside loop
• output of average outside loop

Example: 
```
Total ← 0
FOR Count ← 1 TO 50
  Total ← Total + Number[Count]
NEXT Count
Average ← Total / 50
OUTPUT "The average is ", Average
```
#### s23_qp_22 7
a)
- 07
- 04/12 or 16/18
- 02/20

b)
One mark for each error identified and correction
- Line 07 Total ← Total + Number * Counter
should be Total ← Total + Number[Counter] * Counter
- Line 08 IF Number[Counter] = 0 
  should be IF Number[Counter] = -1 // should be IF Number[Counter] < 0
- Line 16 FOR Counter ← 0 TO 5
should be FOR Counter ← 1 TO 5 

c)
One mark for place in algorithm (max one)
- around lines 05 and 06
- line 07
- (immediately) after the input of the number

Three marks pseudocode
One mark for each point (max three)
- Use of REPEAT … UNTIL // any working loop structure
- check for >0 // >=0
- check for <10 // >9
- check for whole number
- check for -1
- check for length of digit <> 1

Example
REPEAT
 OUTPUT "Enter a digit "
 INPUT Number[Counter]
UNTIL Number[Counter] = Round(Number[Counter],0) AND ((Number[Counter] = -1) OR
 (Number[Counter] > 0 AND Number[Counter] < 10))

#### s23_qp_23 6
a)
One mark per mark point, max four
- Line 01 / Counter ← 100
 should be Counter ← 0
- Line 03 / While Counter > 100 DO
should be While Counter < 100 DO
- Line 07 / Total ← Total + Counter
 should be Total ← Total + Number
- Line 09 / ENDCASE
 should be ENDIF

b)
One mark per mark point, max five
MP1 replace line 03
MP2 with FOR
MP3 … with limits 0 to 99 / 1 to 100
MP4 replace line 05 to check if Number is not positive
MP5 … (if Number is not positive) insert a validation and re-input routine between lines 06 and 07 …
MP6 … that will repeat until a positive value is entered
MP7 remove the counter update / line 08
MP8 replace line 10 / ENDWHILE with NEXT


### 2 基础代码题
#### s23_qp_23 2
One mark per mark point, max four
MOD, max two
- To perform (integer) division when one number is divided by another
- … and find the remainder
- Allow example e.g. 7 MOD 2 = 1
RANDOM, max two
- To generate (pseudo) random numbers
- …(usually) within a specified range
- Allow example e.g. RANDOM() * 10 returns a random number between 0 and 10

#### s23_qp_23 5 b
One mark per mark point, max three
- appropriate REPEAT / WHILE loop begin and end
- input of Length
- appropriate input prompt / error message
- correct loop exit/entry condition / selection

Example answers:
WHILE Loop
OUTPUT "Enter a number between 15 and 35 inclusive"
INPUT Length
WHILE Length <15 OR Length > 35 (DO)
 OUTPUT "Your number must be between 15 and 35 inclusive
 INPUT Length
ENDWHILE
REPEAT Loop
REPEAT
 OUTPUT "Enter a number between 15 and 35 inclusive"
 INPUT Length
UNTIL Length >= 15 AND LENGTH <= 35 

#### s23_qp_21 4
One mark per mark point, max four
DIV, max two
- To perform integer division
- Meaning only the whole number part of the answer is retained
- Example of DIV For example DIV(9,4) = 2
ROUND, max two
- To return a value rounded to a specified number of digits / decimal places
- The result will either be rounded to the next highest or the next lowest value
- … depending on whether the value of the preceding digit is >=5 or <5
- Example of ROUND for example, ROUND(4.56, 1) = 4.6

#### s23_qp_22 4
One mark for each point (max three).
- range check with acceptable values is (greater than) zero and less than 1000
- presence check to ensure the program will not continue until a value has been entered
- type/character check to ensure that a number is entered
- length check to ensure there are no more than 3 digits entered 

To verify the data / for verification / as a verification check // to make sure that no changes are made to the data on entry

One mark for each point (max three).
- use of iteration
- use of two inputs
- to check that the two inputs are the same / different
- use of the given variable Measurement

For example
REPEAT
 OUTPUT "Please enter measurement "
 INPUT Measurement
 OUTPUT "Please re-enter measurement "
 INPUT MeasurementCheck
UNTIL Measurement = MeasurementCheck
